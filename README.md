Hi there my name is Ivica Filipovic 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a redesigned food blog for a coworker at my company. It’s my first project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my basic skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building my basic skills and would love some mentorship.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have Swiss and Croatian passports, was born in Bosnia, and grew up in Switzerland — a true mix of cultures. And when I’m diving, the ocean feels like home no matter where I am. 🐠🌊✨
